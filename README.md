When I first visited Colombia, I was striked by how much landslides affecting roads are part of the everyday life of Colombians, and landslides disaster risks in general. By exploring the data from the Colombian Disaster Risk unit (UNGRD), I wanted to understand the link between landslides and rural urbanizations.

Urbanization in the tropics can accelerate the movement of large landslides [Dill et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-01073-3). The sprawl of urbanized areas can lead to the acceleration of landslide, driven by changes to slope hydrology associated with urbanization such as rerouting of surface water flows and leaky underground infrastructure. Slums, which account for a significant proportion of urban expansion in many developing economies, are often located in areas of high disaster risks such as landslides. Worsening environmental conditions in rural areas can also increase unplanned peri-urban development on unstable slopes. 

-	I first made a map of the landslides from 1998 to 2022, to vizualise the most affected region in the country. According to the Colombian National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), in 2020, approximately 44.5% of the country's population resided in the Andean region, which includes the departments of Antioquia, Boyacá, Cundinamarca, & Santander

If you look at the same map with landslides that only affect roads and transportation systems, you see a similar distribution.

-	To identify more clearly which region and they number of events, I made the following barplot. You can see that Antioquia, Boyacá, Cundinamarca, & Santander are the most affected departments.

-	Distribution of Landslides across municipalities in the top 3 most affected department. From this graph we can observe that Antioquia has a lot of municipalities affected by a small number of derrumbe during the period 1998-2022, while Boyaca and Cundinamarca have a smaller number of municipalities affected by a large number of landslides, i.e. landslides are more concentrated spatially in some municipalities in Boyaca and Cundinamarca

-	Landslides by municipalities and rural population. There seems to have a positive relationship between the two. Of course, this is just a visualization, causes and predictions of landslides depends on other many factors.
