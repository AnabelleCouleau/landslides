# Landslides in Colombia: Data Visualization (1998-2022)

During my first visits to Colombia, I was struck by the prevalence of landslides affecting roads and the significant impact of landslide disaster risks on daily life. By exploring data from the Colombian Disaster Risk Management Unit (UNGRD), I aimed to understand the relationship between landslides and rural urbanization.

Urbanization in tropical regions can accelerate large landslides [Dill et al., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-01073-3). The expansion of urban areas often exacerbates landslide risks due to changes in slope hydrology caused by rerouted surface water flows and leaky underground infrastructure. Slums, which make up a substantial portion of urban growth in many developing countries, are frequently situated in high-risk areas for disasters like landslides. Additionally, worsening environmental conditions in rural regions can drive unplanned peri-urban development on unstable slopes.

## Visualizations

### 1. Landslides from 1998 to 2022

I created a map illustrating landslides across Colombia from 1998 to 2022 to identify the most affected regions. According to the Colombian National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), in 2020, approximately 44.5% of the population lived in the Andean region, encompassing the departments of Antioquia, Boyacá, Cundinamarca, and Santander.

### 2. Landslides Affecting Roads

A map focusing on landslides that impact roads and transportation systems shows that such landslides are widespread across the country, highlighting their potential to disrupt transportation and incur significant costs.

### 3. Landslides by Department

To pinpoint the most affected regions, I created a bar plot showing the number of landslides by department. Antioquia, Boyacá, Cundinamarca, and Santander emerge as the most affected.

### 4. Distribution of Landslides in Top 3 Departments

This graph illustrates the distribution of landslides across municipalities in the top three most affected departments. Antioquia has many municipalities with a small number of landslides, whereas Boyacá and Cundinamarca have fewer municipalities with a higher concentration of landslides.

### 5. Landslides and Rural Population

This visualization suggests a positive relationship between landslides and rural population. However, it is important to note that the causes and predictions of landslides depend on numerous other factors.

By examining these visualizations, we gain insight into the geographic and demographic patterns of landslides in Colombia. This understanding is crucial for developing effective disaster risk management strategies and mitigating the impacts of landslides on communities and infrastructure.
